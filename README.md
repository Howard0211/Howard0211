## Hi there 👋 I'm Howard, a student interested in Python & Data Science!!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about leveraging data to extract meaningful insights and solve real-world problems.

Here you'll find some of my projects and explorations in data science.

## 🌱 What I'm learning

I'm currently improving my skills in:
- Machine Learning
- Database management
- Data Visualization
- Deep Learning

## 👨‍💻 Featured Project: Customer Sentiment Analysis in Product Reviews(Industry-University Cooperation)

### Overview
In this project, I apply traditional machine learning algorithms to analyze customer sentiment in product reviews. By exploring the relationship between positive and negative reviews, I aim to uncover insights into which products customers prefer and the associations between different product attributes and sentiment.

### Techniques Used
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

### Key Findings
- Identification of key features influencing positive and negative reviews
- Visualization of sentiment trends over time or across product categories
- Insights into customer preferences and potential areas for product improvement
